# Top players by points {-} 

In terms of points, none of the top players are particularly familiar. Neither Djokovic or Nadal appear among the top 10 players as is seen in Table 1 below. 

## Table 1: Top 10 tennis players of all time by points 
```{r}
figure1<-topplayers(playersandrankings)

```


# Top players by rank {-} 

The top players in terms of rank are more familiar. Unfortunately my favorite Nadal does only come in at 10th, far behind Djokavic who holds the first position. 

## Table 2: Top 10 tennis players of all time by ranking 
```{r}
figure2<-topplayersrank(playersandrankings)

# Do you have to be tall to be a good tennis player? 

## Figure 1: The height and rank of top tennies players 

Although the scatter plot below illustrates that there is limited correlation between a players height and their ranking. All the top players appear to taller than 170cm. The average South African male is 169cm and thus, the average South African man is definitely not going to be a pro tennis player. 
```{r}
figure3<-heightplot(playersandrankings)

```


# Do lefties play tennis? 

Lefties seem to be relatively good at tennis, making up 13% of the top tennis players but only 10% of the population.
