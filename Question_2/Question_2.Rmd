# Introduction {-}
There are so many reasons not to move to London but in this document I will name but a few. London is cold, London in rainy and third, there is a zero percent change of running into me. 


# Do you really like wet socks? {-}

It rains nearly 50% of the time! The amount of rain in London  basically guarantees you'll be stomping in puddles and going to work with wet socks. Do you really like wet socks? (Note: I kept receiving the error: Error in dir.exists(lib.loc) : invalid filename argument and i couldn't fix it in time so I just screengrabbed the tables so I could knit my markdown, the code for the table is in "frequencytable.R").

## Table 1: The frequency of rainy days in London  {-}

# Wet and cold? No thank you {-}

Not only is London super wet. It is also super cold. Where the average annual temperature in London is a chilly 12.7 degrees, in sunny South Africa it is 17.5 degrees. From the graph below it is clear than many days are spent below the average in London.

# There's a lot of snow in London {-}
The maximum snow depth in London is taller than a small cat, this is an illustration of what that might look like.
